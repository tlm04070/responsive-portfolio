	 		<p>Welcome to my page, thanks for stopping by! I have a background in construction working for a general contractor, as well as inpecting experience working for an engineering firm. I'm currently learning how to become a fullstack web developer through the UNC Charlotte coding bootcamp. 
			The language I'm looking forward to learning and using the most would be javascript in the react framework, as well as nodejs for the back end functionality of everything. I plan on using these skills to design web applications for customers either through a company as an employee, or freelanced though the internet. 
			</p>
			<p>I belive that these skills, and this field in general is the absolute best place to be moving forwrad, as everything is always changing and updating, getting faster and more streamlined. The automation of everything is happening at an alarming rate, and being on the other side of that trend, the side that can spead the same language as the programs is in my opinion the only way to move forward.
			</p>
